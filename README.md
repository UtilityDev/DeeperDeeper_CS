# Deeper & Deeper âš¡

## What is it? ðŸŒŽ
A simple but fun game about avoiding obstacles. The game was originally written in Python (https://github.com/UtilityDev/Deeper-Deeper), but has now been rewritten and absolutely improved in C# with Raylib! This version includes proper collision detection (I know, simple stuff?), which means that the possibility of death is actually present, unlike the Python version :P

This project is important to me because it just shows how much I've improved as a programmer. This is the first project where I really utilize the power of object-oriented programming and polymorphism. Can't wait to make similar stuff in the future.
